🚗SmartPark: AI-Based Parking Spot Finder with Vehicle Classification

SmartPark is an intelligent parking management system that uses deep learning to identify the type of vehicle entering a parking lot and determines if there are available slots for it. This beginner-friendly project combines image classification using CNN and a clean Streamlit interface for real-time interaction.

🚀 Features

🚗 Vehicle type detection (Car, Bus, Truck, Bike) using a trained CNN model
🅿️ Real-time parking slot availability check based on vehicle type
🌐 Simple and responsive Streamlit-powered web interface
📊 Model evaluation with accuracy graph, loss, and confusion matrix



💡 How It Works

Upload an image of the incoming vehicle
The trained model predicts the vehicle class
The system checks if slots for that class are available
It then displays whether entry is allowed based on availability
